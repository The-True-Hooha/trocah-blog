Our presentation addressed the pressing concerns surrounding AI ethics, recognizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and security in this rapidly evolving field. In an era where AI is increasingly being embedded into various aspects of our lives, it becomes imperative to ensure that its development and application align with our values and principles.

Damilola highlighted the opportunities that arise when leveraging AI in the Trocah Technology platform, paving the way for enhanced efficiency, improved decision-making, and innovative solutions. However, he emphasized the importance of striking a balance between technological advancements and responsible AI implementation to mitigate any negative impacts.
